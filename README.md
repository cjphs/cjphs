While programming, I enjoy listening to specific types of music... some of my recommendations are [Øneheart](https://iamoneheart.bandcamp.com/) (for calm ambient mixes), [HOME](https://home96.bandcamp.com/) (for "in the zone" programming sessions), and [Carpenter Brut](https://carpenterbrut.bandcamp.com/) (for those aggressive programming sessions that may result in accidentally breaking your keyboard).
